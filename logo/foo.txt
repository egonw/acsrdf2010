PubChem is a public and open archive for the biological activities of small molecules. PubChem provides search and analysis capabilities to assist users to locate desired information. This is especially important given that the PubChem contents are both vast (with tens of millions of unique chemical structures and over hundred million biological test results) and diffuse (with an uneven distribution of biological annotation of contained compounds). Many of the analysis tools PubChem provides utilize the notion of chemical similarity. PubChem3D adds a new integrated layer to the existing capabilities of the PubChem platform. This includes a theoretical 3-D description for PubChem Compound records and the notion of 3-D similarity, to augment 2-D similarity approaches. This thematic series covers: the technology and methodology behind the PubChem3D project, enabling it to function and scale; the validation and analysis of the PubChem3D content and approach; and the various PubChem3D components, with examples of how they can be of utility to researchers.
