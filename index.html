        <div class="hidden">
The distribution of computational resources as web services and their execution
as workflows has enabled facile computation and data integration for bio− and
cheminformatics. The Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration (SADI)
framework addresses many shortcomings of similar frameworks, such as SSWAP and
BioMoby, while allowing for more efficient semantic envelopment of computational
chemistry services, resource discovery, and automated workflow organization. In
this work, we apply the CHEMINF ontology and Chemical Entity Semantic
Specification and demonstrate the usability of the SADI framework in solving
common cheminformatics problems starting from RDF−based chemical entity
representations. Our eventual goal is to convert all of the functions and
functionalities of the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) into distinct SADI
services. This would enable the formulation of all cheminformatics problems
currently addressed by CDK, as SPARQL queries, returning meaningful RDF output
which can then be easily integrated with existing RDF−based knowledgebases or
used for further processing.

        <div class="hidden">
The Open Source Predictive Toxicology Framework http://www.opentox.org,
developed by partners of the EC FP7 OpenTox project , aims at providing a
unified access to toxicity data and predictive models, as well as validation
procedures. This is achieved by i) an information model, based on a common
OWL−DL ontology http://www.opentox.org/api/1.1/opentox.owl ii) flexibility by
linking with related ontologies; iii) availability of data and algorithms via a
standardized REST web services interface, where every compound, data set or
predictive method has an unique web address, used to retrieve its RDF
representation, or initiate the calculations. The OpenTox framework allows
building user−friendly applications for toxicological experts or model
developers, or direct access by an application programming interface for
development, integration and validation of new algorithms. The work presented
describes the experience of building RESTful web services, based on RDF
representation of resources, to incorporate diverse IT solutions into a
distributed and interoperable system.

        <div class="hidden">
Semantic web technologies are finding their way into the life sciences.
Ontologies and semantic markup have already been used for more than a decade in
molecular sciences, but have not found widespread use yet. The semantic web
technology Resource Description Framework (RDF) and related methods show to be
sufficiently versatile to change that situation. The work presented here focuses
on linking RDF approaches to existing molecular chemometrics fields, including
cheminformatics, QSAR modeling and proteochemometrics. Applications are
presented that link RDF technologies to methods from statistics and
cheminformatics, including data aggregation, visualization, chemical
identification, and property prediction. They demonstrate how this can be done
using various existing RDF standards and cheminformatics libraries. For example,
we show how IC50 and Ki values are modeled for a number of biological targets
using data from the chEMBL database. We have shown that existing RDF standards
can suitably be integrated into existing molecular chemometrics methods.
Platforms that unite these technologies, like Bioclipse, makes this even simpler
and more transparent. Being able to create and share workflows that integrate
data aggregation and analysis (visual and statistical) is beneficial to
interoperability and reproducibility. The current work shows that RDF approaches
are sufficiently powerful to support molecular chemometrics workflows.

Our Chemical e−Science Information Cloud (ChemCloud) − a Semantic Web based
eScience infrastructure − integrates and automates a multitude of databases,
tools and services in the domain of chemistry, pharmacy and bio−chemistry
available at the Fachinformationszentrum Chemie (FIZ Chemie), at the Freie
Universitaet Berlin (FUB), and on the public Web. Based on the approach of the
W3C Linked Open Data initiative and the W3C Semantic Web technologies for
ontologies and rules it semantically links and integrates knowledge from our W3C
HCLS knowledge base hosted at the FUB, our multi−domain knowledge base DBpedia
(Deutschland) implemented at FUB, which is extracted from Wikipedia (De)
providing a public semantic resource for chemistry, and our well−established
databases at FIZ Chemie such as ChemInform for organic reaction data, InfoTherm
the leading source for thermophysical data, Chemisches Zentralblatt, the
complete chemistry knowledge from 1830 to 1969, and ChemgaPedia the largest and
most frequented e−Learning platform for Chemistry and related sciences in German
language.

        <a href="javascript:;" onclick="javascript: $(this).next().toggle('slow');">Abstract</a>
        <div class="hidden">
Resource Description Framework (RDF) and a set of associated technologies like
OWL, SPARQL etc..., which form the W3C's semantic web technology stack, are
renewing interest in semantic chemistry. Semantic Web Services not only specify
syntactic interoperability but also specify and enforce the semantic constraints
of messages being transmitted and objects being accessed. Liceptor database is a
small molecule ligand database consisting of approximately 4 million compounds.
The database schema consists of fields like molecular properties (2D−structure,
molecular weight, molecular formula etc...), molecular descriptors (H−donors,
H−acceptors, logP, logD number of rotational bonds etc...) and pharmacological
properties (bio−assays, receptors, enzymes, parameters, animal models,
therapeutic indications etc...). Pharmaceutical and Bio−Technology companies use
this database to mine chemical space for internal research, to prioritize QSAR
and pharmacophore studies, for synthetic chemistry endeavors and for advancing
hit−to−lead patterns. The database records are available in multiple formats
(relational database, XML, Rdfile etc...) as well as available online through an
interactive web application (html format). The soon to be released version of
the database includes access using semantic web services. The ontology is
expressed in OWL and RDF defines the overall framework. Typical consumers of the
data using this access mechanism are expected to be third−party tool vendors and
data aggregators. Use of semantic web services allows evolution of the schema
over time without explicitly communicating the change as well as requiring all
data consumers to be changed.
