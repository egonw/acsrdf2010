The American Chemical Society (ACS) Division of Chemical Information (CINF)
invited scientists from around the world to present their use of RDF
technologies in chemistry on 22nd-23rd August 2010
at the 240th ACS National Meeting in Boston, USA. During three half-day
sessions, the speakers demonstrated a mix of smaller and larger initiatives
where Resource Description Framework (RDF) technologies are used in cheminformatics and
bioinformatics as Open Standards for data exchange, common languages
(ontologies), and problem solving. This Thematic Series introduces
work presented at that meeting, showing the current advances in
cheminformatics using these RDF technologies.
Article processing charges for this Thematic Series have been partially
funded by Pfizer, Inc.  Pfizer, Inc. has had no input into the content
of the publication or the articles themselves.  All articles in the
series have been independently prepared by the authors and have been
subject to the journal's standard peer review process.
