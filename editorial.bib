@article{Aranguren2007,
    abstract = {:The bio-ontology community falls into two camps: first we have biology domain experts, who actually hold the knowledge we wish to capture in ontologies; second, we have ontology specialists, who hold knowledge about techniques and best practice on ontology development. In the bio-ontology domain, these two camps have often come into conflict, especially where pragmatism comes into conflict with perceived best practice. One of these areas is the insistence of computer scientists on a well-defined semantic basis for the Knowledge Representation language being used. In this article, we will first describe why this community is so insistent. Second, we will illustrate this by examining the semantics of the Web Ontology Language and the semantics placed on the Directed Acyclic Graph as used by the Gene Ontology. Finally we will reconcile the two representations, including the broader Open Biomedical Ontologies format. The ability to exchange between the two representations means that we can capitalise on the features of both languages. Such utility can only arise by the understanding of the semantics of the languages being used. By this illustration of the usefulness of a clear, well-defined language semantics, we wish to promote a wider understanding of the computer science perspective amongst potential users within the biological community.},

These core data are then integrated to construct chemical–gene–disease networks and to predict many novel relationships using different types of associated data. Since 2009, we dramatically increased the content of {CTD} to 1.4 million chemical–gene–disease data points and added many features, statistical analyses and analytical tools, including {GeneComps} and {ChemComps} (to find comparable genes and chemicals that share toxicogenomic profiles), enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with chemicals, statistically ranked chemical–disease inferences, Venn diagram tools to discover overlapping and unique attributes of any set of chemicals, genes or disease, and enhanced gene pathway data content, among other features. Together, this wealth of expanded chemical–gene–disease data continues to help users generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of environmental diseases. {CTD} is freely available at http://ctd.mdibl.org.},

What are the incentives for the adoption of the Semantic Web, and who are the facilitators? Is there going to be a Semantic Web revolution in the life {sciences?We} report here a few reflections on these questions, following discussions at the {SWAT4LS} (Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Life Sciences) workshop series, of which this Journal of Biomedical Semantics special issue presents selected papers from the 2009 edition, held in Amsterdam on November 20th.},

    abstract = {{OpenTox} provides an interoperable, standards-based Framework for the support of predictive toxicology data management, algorithms, modelling, validation and reporting. It is relevant to satisfying the chemical safety assessment requirements of the {REACH} legislation as it supports access to experimental data, (Quantitative) {Structure-Activity} Relationship models, and toxicological information through an integrating platform that adheres to regulatory requirements and {OECD} validation principles. Initial research defined the essential components of the Framework including the approach to data access, schema and management, use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies, architecture, web service and communications protocols, and selection and integration of algorithms for predictive modelling. {OpenTox} provides end-user oriented tools to non-computational specialists, risk assessors, and toxicological experts in addition to Application Programming Interfaces ({APIs}) for developers of new applications. {OpenTox} actively supports public standards for data representation, interfaces, vocabularies and ontologies, Open Source approaches to core platform components, and community-based collaboration approaches, so as to progress system interoperability {goals.The} {OpenTox} Framework includes {APIs} and services for compounds, datasets, features, algorithms, models, ontologies, tasks, validation, and reporting which may be combined into multiple applications satisfying a variety of different user needs. {OpenTox} applications are based on a set of distributed, interoperable {OpenTox} {API}-compliant {REST} web services. The {OpenTox} approach to ontology allows for efficient mapping of complementary data coming from different datasets into a unifying structure having a shared terminology and {representation.Two} initial {OpenTox} applications are presented as an illustration of the potential impact of {OpenTox} for high-quality and consistent structure-activity relationship modelling of {REACH}-relevant endpoints: {ToxPredict} which predicts and reports on toxicities for endpoints for an input chemical structure, and {ToxCreate} which builds and validates a predictive toxicity model based on an input toxicology dataset. Because of the extensible nature of the standardised Framework design, barriers of interoperability between applications and content are removed, as the user may combine data, models and validation from multiple sources in a dependable and time-effective way.},

@article{Cheung2009,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:As interest in adopting the Semantic Web in the biomedical domain continues to grow, Semantic Web technology has been evolving and maturing. A variety of technological approaches including triplestore technologies, {SPARQL} endpoints, Linked Data, and Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets have emerged in recent years. In addition to the data warehouse construction, these technological approaches can be used to support dynamic query federation. As a community effort, the {BioRDF} task force, within the Semantic Web for Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group, is exploring how these emerging approaches can be utilized to execute distributed queries across different neuroscience data {sources.METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}:We have created two health care and life science knowledge bases. We have explored a variety of Semantic Web approaches to describe, map, and dynamically query multiple datasets. We have demonstrated several federation approaches that integrate diverse types of information about neurons and receptors that play an important role in basic, clinical, and translational neuroscience research. Particularly, we have created a prototype receptor explorer which uses {OWL} mappings to provide an integrated list of receptors and executes individual queries against different {SPARQL} endpoints. We have also employed the {AIDA} Toolkit, which is directed at groups of knowledge workers who cooperatively search, annotate, interpret, and enrich large collections of heterogeneous documents from diverse locations. We have explored a tool called "{FeDeRate}", which enables a global {SPARQL} query to be decomposed into subqueries against the remote databases offering either {SPARQL} or {SQL} query interfaces. Finally, we have explored how to use the vocabulary of interlinked Datasets ({voiD}) to create metadata for describing datasets exposed as Linked Data {URIs} or {SPARQL} {endpoints.CONCLUSION}:We have demonstrated the use of a set of novel and state-of-the-art Semantic Web technologies in support of a neuroscience query federation scenario. We have identified both the strengths and weaknesses of these technologies. While Semantic Web offers a global data model including the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers ({URI}'s), the proliferation of semantically-equivalent {URI}'s hinders large scale data integration. Our work helps direct research and tool development, which will be of benefit to this community.},

    abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on different websites. Although {RDF} was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. {Bio2RDF} is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in {JSP}, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an {OWL} ontology. With {Bio2RDF}, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, {PDB}, {MGI}, {HGNC} and several of {NCBI}'s databases can now be made available in {RDF} format through a unique {URL} in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The {Bio2RDF} project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of {RDF} documents linked together with normalized {URIs} and sharing a common ontology. {Bio2RDF} is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The {Bio2RDF} repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

    abstract = {The Semantic Web technology enables integration of heterogeneous data on the World Wide Web by making the semantics of data explicit through formal ontologies. In this article, we survey the feasibility and state of the art of utilizing the Semantic Web technology to represent, integrate and analyze the knowledge in various biomedical networks. We introduce a new conceptual framework, semantic graph mining, to enable researchers to integrate graph mining with ontology reasoning in network data analysis. Through four case studies, we demonstrate how semantic graph mining can be applied to the analysis of disease-causal genes, Gene Ontology category cross-talks, drug efficacy analysis and herb\^{a}drug interactions analysis.},

    abstract = {The scientific literature represents a rich source for retrieval of knowledge on associations between biomedical concepts such as genes, diseases and cellular processes. A commonly used method to establish relationships between biomedical concepts from literature is co-occurrence. Apart from its use in knowledge retrieval, the co-occurrence method is also well-suited to discover new, hidden relationships between biomedical concepts following a simple {ABC}-principle, in which A and C have no direct relationship, but are connected via shared B-intermediates. In this paper we describe {CoPub} Discovery, a tool that mines the literature for new relationships between biomedical concepts. Statistical analysis using {ROC} curves showed that {CoPub} Discovery performed well over a wide range of settings and keyword thesauri. We subsequently used {CoPub} Discovery to search for new relationships between genes, drugs, pathways and diseases. Several of the newly found relationships were validated using independent literature sources. In addition, new predicted relationships between compounds and cell proliferation were validated and confirmed experimentally in an in vitro cell proliferation assay. The results show that {CoPub} Discovery is able to identify novel associations between genes, drugs, pathways and diseases that have a high probability of being biologically valid. This makes {CoPub} Discovery a useful tool to unravel the mechanisms behind disease, to find novel drug targets, or to find novel applications for existing drugs.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Life scientists need help in coping with the plethora of fast growing and scattered knowledge resources. Ideally, this knowledge should be integrated in a form that allows them to pose complex questions that address the properties of biological systems, independently from the origin of the knowledge. Semantic Web technologies prove to be well suited for knowledge integration, knowledge production (hypothesis formulation), knowledge querying and knowledge {maintenance.RESULTS}:We implemented a semantically integrated resource named {BioGateway}, comprising the entire set of the {OBO} foundry candidate ontologies, the {GO} annotation files, the {SWISS}-{PROT} protein set, the {NCBI} taxonomy and several in-house ontologies. {BioGateway} provides a single entry point to query these resources through {SPARQL}. It constitutes a key component for a Semantic Systems Biology approach to generate new hypotheses concerning systems properties. In the course of developing {BioGateway}, we faced challenges that are common to other projects that involve large datasets in diverse representations. We present a detailed analysis of the obstacles that had to be overcome in creating {BioGateway}. We demonstrate the potential of a comprehensive application of Semantic Web technologies to global biomedical {data.CONCLUSION}:The time is ripe for launching a community effort aimed at a wider acceptance and application of Semantic Web technologies in the life sciences. We call for the creation of a forum that strives to implement a truly semantic life science foundation for Semantic Systems {Biology.Access} to the system and supplementary information (such as a listing of the data sources in {RDF}, and sample queries) can be found at http://www.semantic-systems-biology.org/biogateway.},

    abstract = {This work presents thermochemical data for possible gas phase intermediate species in an industrial rutile chlorinator. An algorithm developed for previous work is employed to ensure that all possible species are considered, reducing the number of important species neglected. Thermochemical data and enthalpies of formation are calculated for 22 new species using density functional theory, post {Hartree−Fock} coupled cluster calculations, and statistical mechanics. Equilibrium calculations are performed to identify whether any {Ti/C} intermediates are likely to be important to the high temperature industrial process. These new species are not present at high concentration in the exit stream. It is therefore likely that the two chemical processes do not interact. Rather, the Cl2 rapidly reacts with the solid {TiO2} to form {TiCl4} and O2. The latter then reacts with the solid C to form {CO} and {CO2} and provide the heat. Data for all the new species is provided as Supporting Information. Finally, a new methodology for data collaboration is investigated in which the data is made openly accessible using the resource description framework. Example scripts are provided to demonstrate how to query and retrieve the data automatically.},

The absence of sufficient high-quality metadata prevents intelligent computer access to the data without human intervention. This creates barriers to the automation of data mining in activities such as quantitative structure−activity relationship modelling. The application of Semantic Web technologies to chemical data is shown to reduce these limitations. The use of unique identifiers and relationships (represented as uniform resource identifiers, {URIs}, and resource description framework, {RDF}) held in a triplestore provides for greater detail and flexibility in the sharing and storage of molecular structures and properties.},
